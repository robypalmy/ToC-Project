## How to generate a new graph

```
graph_generator.py
```

Input the number of nodes, edges, the name of the file and the type of the graph.


Example:

```
$ python3 graph_generator.py
Input number of nodes in the graph: 20
Input number of edges in the graph: 100
Input graph file name: g3.txt

Graphs type:
1 - Random Graph
2 - Hamiltonian Cycle Graph
Choose type of graph: 2
```

It will save a graph with 20 nodes and 100 edges in the file g3.txt, having a Hamiltonian Cycle.
